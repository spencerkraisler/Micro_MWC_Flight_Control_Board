# Micro_MWC_Flight_Control_Board
I built this repository to store some scripts that work on the Micro MWC Flight Control Board. The code used on this board is identitcal to the code used on the Arduino. To flash it, open up the Arduino IDE and select 'Arduino Pro or Pro Mini' s the board. For someone with little experience with microcontrollers (e.g. me), I felt it'd be nice to post some scripts that access the various components in this MCU (such as gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer, and the motor drivers)
